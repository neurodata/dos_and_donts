    "# Simulation 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Vivek Gopalakrishnan | June 26, 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if an edge is significantly different across 2 populations, should \n",
    "you use a T-test, the Mann Whitney U Test, or Fisher's Exact Test?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this experiment, we use the indpendent edge (IE) model. \n",
    "- According to this model, the weight of each edge is given by an independent\n",
    "Bernoulli randomn variable, i.e. $\\Pr{(A_{ij} = 1)} = p_{ij}$. \n",
    "- The matrix of all $p_{ij}$'s is called the P matrix.\n",
    "- We generate two samples from different IE models. Each model has a\n",
    "symmetric P matrix with the same shape (therefore, each simulated graph\n",
    "has the same number of nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let \n",
    "$\\mathbf{b}$ be a vector of length $n$ linearly \n",
    "increasing over the range $[\\epsilon, 1-\\epsilon]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Let \n",
    "$\\mathbf{P_1}$ be a grid determined by $\\mathbf{b}$, i.e. \n",
    "$\\mathbf{P_1}(1,1) = \\mathbf{b}_1, \\mathbf{P_1}(1,2) = \\mathbf{b}_2, ...$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Let \n",
    "$\n",
    "\\mathbf{P_2}(u,v) = \\begin{cases} \n",
    "    \\mathbf{P_1}(u,v) + \\delta \\hspace{6mm} \\text{if} \\hspace{2mm} \\mathbf{P_1}(u,v) < 0.5 \\\\\n",
    "    \\mathbf{P_1}(u,v) - \\delta \\hspace{6mm} \\text{if} \\hspace{2mm} \\mathbf{P_1}(u,v) \\geq 0.5\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sample\n",
    "$X_i \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} \\text{IE}(\\mathbf{P_1})$ and \n",
    "$Y_i \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} \\text{IE}(\\mathbf{P_2})$\n",
    "for $i=1,...,m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $\\mathbf{P_1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ \n",
    "and $\\mathbf{P_2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "For each edge $ij$, \n",
    "1. Use the T-test to test the null hypothesis $\\text{mean}(X_{ij}) = \\text{mean}(Y_{ij})$\n",
    "2. Use Kruskal-Wallis to test the null hypothesis $\\text{median}(X_{ij}) = \\text{median}(Y_{ij})$\n",
    "3. Use Fisher's Exact Test to get the exact probability of observing any combination of edges\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the power versus $\\mathbf{P}_{ij}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes about Kruskal-Wallis\n",
    "- Kruskal-Wallis is the multisample generalization of the 2-sample Mann-Whitney\n",
    "U test.\n",
    "- Kruskal-Wallis doesn't assume that the samples are paired like Wilcoxon does."
